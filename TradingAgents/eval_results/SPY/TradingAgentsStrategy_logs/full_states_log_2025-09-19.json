        "news_report": "### Recent Global Macroeconomic Insights (September 12-19, 2025)\n\nIn analyzing the macroeconomic landscape over the past week, several key developments have surfaced that could significantly impact trading, particularly concerning the SPY (S&P 500 ETF). Below is a detailed overview of the pertinent macroeconomic factors and news trends.\n\n#### Key Global Events\n\n1. **U.S. Federal Reserve's Interest Rate Decision (September 17, 2025)**:\n   - The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decided to maintain the federal funds rate at **5.25%**. This move underscores a cautious approach to monetary policy amid persistent inflation concerns. The decision was largely anticipated and contributed to a stabilizing effect on financial markets as traders adjusted their expectations regarding future rate hikes.\n\n2. **Eurozone Economic Growth Data (September 15, 2025)**:\n   - Eurostat reported an economic expansion of **0.3%** in the second quarter of 2025\u2014slightly below the market expectation of **0.4%**. This slower growth raises concerns about the Eurozone's resilience and may weaken the euro against other currencies, influencing global trade dynamics and investment flows.\n\n3. **China's Trade Balance Report (September 14, 2025)**:\n   - China posted a **$70 billion** trade surplus for August, exceeding forecasts of **$65 billion**. The surplus indicates strong export performance, especially in electronics and machinery, signaling robust global demand. This positive news is supportive for the Chinese yuan and may benefit markets tied to Chinese economic activity.\n\n4. **U.K. Inflation Data (September 13, 2025)**:\n   - The UK's Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by **2.1%** year-over-year in August, slightly above the Bank of England's target of **2%**. This development could prompt the Bank of England to reconsider its monetary policy stance, which may cause fluctuations in the pound and influence the broader economic environment in Europe.\n\n5. **Global Oil Prices Fluctuations (September 12-19, 2025)**:\n   - Oil prices faced volatility due to geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and supply disruptions in several oil-producing regions. These fluctuations bear significant implications for global inflation rates and economic recovery, which traders are monitoring closely as they could affect sectors dependent on oil and energy.\n\n#### Market Implications\n\n- **Interest Rates**: A stable interest rate from the Federal Reserve may lead to continued investor confidence in equities, especially within the SPY. However, the implications of inflation trends must still be monitored closely.\n- **Currency Performance**: Slower growth in Europe could put downward pressure on the euro, while a strong Chinese trade balance may bolster demand for commodities and related sectors in the U.S.\n- **Inflation Expectations**: The rise in U.K. inflation could signal potential shifts in global interest rates as central banks respond, emphasizing the need for traders to stay informed about global monetary policy.\n\n### Summary Table of Key Points\n\n| Date             | Event/News                             | Implications                                         |\n|------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| September 17     | Fed maintains 5.25% rate              | Stabilizes markets; trader confidence in equities    |\n| September 15     | Eurozone growth at 0.3%               | Concerns about economic resilience in the Eurozone   |\n| September 14     | China reports $70 billion surplus      | Stronger yuan; positive outlook for export-driven sectors |\n| September 13     | U.K. CPI rose 2.1%                    | Possible re-evaluation of BOE policy and impact on GBP |\n| September 12-19  | Volatile oil prices                    | Significant implications for inflation and economic growth |\n\nIn conclusion, the macroeconomic developments of the past week illustrate a critical juncture for traders and investors. The interplay of interest rates, inflation, and currency fluctuations presents both challenges and opportunities across global markets, particularly for the S&P 500 and its constituent sectors.\n\nFINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **HOLD**",
        "fundamentals_report": "Here is a comprehensive report on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) as of September 19, 2025, focusing on the fundamental information available:\n\n## Company Overview: SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY)\n- **Ticker**: SPY\n- **Type**: Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF)\n- **Market**: USA\n- **Objective**: The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust aims to provide investment returns that, before expenses, correspond generally to the price and yield performance of the S&P 500 Index.\n\n## Current Stock Market Information\n- **Current Price**: $683.39\n- **Change from Previous Close**: +$3.72 (+0.01%)\n- **Open Price**: $680.95\n- **Intraday High**: $683.645\n- **Intraday Low**: $680.65\n- **Intraday Volume**: 46,912,271 shares\n- **Latest Trade Time**: September 19, 2025, 10:30 AM PST\n\n## Financial Analysis\nAs an ETF, SPY does not have traditional financial metrics like P/E or P/S ratios typically used to evaluate individual companies.

            "bull_history": "\nBull Analyst: Certainly! Let's dive into the case for investing in SPY, addressing the points raised by bear analysts while highlighting the strong growth potential, competitive advantages, and positive market indicators that support a bullish perspective.\n\n### Growth Potential\nThe SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) is not just a fund; it\u2019s a direct conduit to the performance of the S&P 500, which comprises America\u2019s most influential and high-performing companies. With continued advancements across sectors like technology, healthcare, and renewable energy, the market remains ripe for growth. \n\nAs noted, SPY\u2019s recent price activity, closing at $683.39 on September 19, 2025, reflects growing investor confidence post a notable rebound phase after some fluctuations earlier in the year. This uptick isn\u2019t an isolated event, but rather part of a broader trend fueled by increasing corporate earnings reports and ongoing robust economic indicators\u2014even in the face of inflationary pressures.\n\n**Revenue Projections and Scalability**: As we look ahead, SPY is positioned to capture exponential gains. With various indices reflecting a bullish sentiment, forecasts suggest the S&P 500 could maintain robust growth in the near term. As more investors, both retail and institutional, look to allocate funds into equities, SPY\u2019s scalability becomes evident. Given its passive investment approach, it easily absorbs increasing inflows without impacting fund performance.\n\n### Competitive Advantages\nSPY holds several competitive advantages that bolster its attractiveness as an investment. Being the first ETF to track the S&P 500, it enjoys unparalleled brand recognition and trust among investors. Think of it as the 'blue chip' of ETFs. \n\nThis competitive edge is reinforced by its liquidity and low expense ratios, making it an appealing choice for both long-term investors and quick traders. The influx of algorithmic trading, accounting for a substantial 73% of SPY\u2019s recent trading volume, illustrates strong interest from sophisticated investors who are capitalizing on market movements. \n\nNotably, the fund provides exposure to a diversified set of sectors, minimizing risk during economic uncertainties\u2014something a single-stock investment simply cannot offer.\n\n### Positive Indicators\nLet\u2019s not overlook critical financial health and market indicators that solidify the bull case for SPY:\n- **50-Day and 200-Day SMAs**: SPY\u2019s current trading price is well above both these averages, reinforcing a stable bullish trend. Furthermore, this establishes a solid support foundation, providing reassurance to investors against potential correction.\n- **Momentum Indicators**: The MACD strongly suggests positive short-term momentum, reinforcing a bullish outlook. While the RSI at 72.56 indicates that SPY might be entering overbought territory, it also reflects strong buyer interest\u2014a sign of resilience.\n- **Recent Market Sentiment**: Positive sentiment in social media and traditional markets indicates that investors are increasingly inclined to favor equities, with SPY eventuating into a preferred vehicle for capturing the S&P 500\u2019s upward movements.\n\n### Countering Bearish Arguments\nNow, let\u2019s address some common bearish points. A frequent concern revolves around the potential overbought conditions indicated by the high RSI and recent volatility. While it\u2019s true that an RSI in the 70s suggests possible exhaustion, it\u2019s essential to recognize that the groundwork for continued growth is present. Historical performances during previous overbought conditions, especially for the S&P 500, often led to prolonged uptrends rather than reversals.\n\n**Reflection on Past Lessons**: I acknowledge that there have been moments in history where overly cautious approaches to overbought indicators led to missed opportunities. For instance, during the robust bull market of 2020-2021, many analysts were overly wary of corrective movements due to high RSI levels, only to see the market continue its climb. It\u2019s crucial to differentiate between a true downturn and temporary market adjustments.\n\nMoreover, the current economic backdrop, with stable interest rates after the Fed\u2019s recent decision to maintain the federal funds rate at 5.25%, creates a conducive environment for equities. Investor confidence typically flourishes when rates stabilize, as is the case now.\n\n### Engagement and Final Thoughts\nIn conclusion, while bears may highlight overbought signals and recent volatility as red flags, the overwhelming growth potential, competitive advantages, and positive market sentiments toward SPY present a compelling case for taking a bullish stance. Recognizing when to act is part and parcel of investing, and given the solid fundamentals in place for SPY, the bullish outlook holds a stronger merit.\n\nI invite bears to consider these insights and reflect on their positions: to err on the side of caution might make sense in theory, but when the fundamentals and market dynamics are so robust, it often translates into missed opportunities. Let\u2019s not forget the lessons learned from past market cycles about embracing growth potential amidst uncertainty. \n\nThe recommended action here is to remain invested in SPY, as it stands to benefit from a dynamic market landscape demonstrating resilience and opportunity.",
            "bear_history": "\nBear Analyst: Absolutely, let\u2019s engage in this conversation and unpack the case against investing in SPY, while thoughtfully countering the bullish sentiments presented by my colleague.\n\n### Risks and Challenges\n\nFirst off, it\u2019s important to be mindful of the inherent risks in the current market landscape. The recent volatility you've noted\u2014with daily swings exceeding 3%\u2014is indicative of instability that should concern potential investors. While volatility can entice traders, it's equally a warning sign for long-term investors. The fact that algorithmic trading constituted **73% of the total volume** means that much of the trading activity is dictated by algorithms, which can add to market unpredictability. Such disproportionate reliance on algorithmic trading is often a harbinger of inflated prices and potential sharp corrections.\n\n### Market Saturation and Economic Threats\n\nRegarding growth potential, while SPY represents a broad swath of the market, one has to consider how much room is left for expansion. The S&P 500 has become increasingly saturated, making it difficult for many large-cap companies to sustain historic growth rates. We should not overlook the potential headwinds posed by macroeconomic factors such as persistent inflation, which the Federal Reserve is still grappling with despite keeping interest rates steady at **5.25%**. These macroeconomic variables threaten to erode consumer spending and sentiment, which are vital for driving the earnings growth that supports stock prices.\n\n### Competitive Weaknesses\n\nThough SPY is presented as having competitive advantages, it's also essential to reflect on its limitations. Its status as the first ETF tracking the S&P 500 may be an advantage, but it doesn't insulate it from competition. New entrants are constantly emerging with lower expense ratios and innovative structures that could draw investor attention away from SPY. \n\nAdditionally, let\u2019s critically assess the claim that SPY is a \u2018blue chip\u2019 investment. A passive fund\u2019s performance is inherently tied to the conditions of the underlying index. Should the S&P 500 face challenges\u2014be that economic recessions or sector-specific downturns\u2014SPY will suffer accordingly. Investments focused solely on passive strategies might be more vulnerable to changes in dynamics than those that leverage active management.\n\n### Negative Indicators \n\nThe technical indicators, such as the **RSI at 72.56**, signal an overbought condition that shouldn\u2019t be glossed over. While the bullish narrative frames this as a sign of resilience, it actually casts a shadow on sustainability. Overbought conditions often lead to corrections. In the past, over-reliance on buoyant market sentiment has led investors to accumulate positions right before major downturns, such as the sharp corrections in 2018 and 2020.\n\nFurthermore, the **Bollinger Bands** suggest SPY is trading near its upper band. Historically, such positioning tends to precede volatility and possible retractions, especially when coupled with high RSI readings. Bull analysts may argue that these indicators are typical in healthy bull markets, but even healthy markets correct.\n\n### Addressing Bull Counterpoints\n\nA common bullish comeback to overbought conditions is that they have historically ushered in prolonged uptrends. However, it\u2019s essential to contextualize this: much of the market's historical performance cannot be matched to the current economic environment characterized by supply chain issues, inflation, and high-interest rates. Past lessons learned during downturns have shown that continuous growth cannot be assumed, particularly when macroeconomic indicators signal potential trouble.\n\nMoreover, while SPY serves as a relative \u201csafe haven\u201d for investors in equity markets, its perceived stability is tenuous at best in this environment. Experiencing record inflows does not guarantee continued performance, especially if investor sentiment shifts as economic realities set in.\n\n### Engagement and Final Thoughts \n\nIn conclusion, while I acknowledge the potential bullish arguments presented, it's essential to critically evaluate the complex interplay of macroeconomic factors, competitive challenges, and overbought conditions fundamentally undermining SPY\u2019s current strength. \n\nInvestors should not overlook the lessons of the past\u2014such as the risks of ignoring market saturation, reliance on passive strategies amidst evolving market dynamics\u2014especially with indications signaling potential volatility ahead. Convincing a bull investor requires more than just momentum; it demands a comprehensive understanding of risk, and a proactive stance to not only pursue opportunities but to also manage potential losses.\n\nThus, staying cautious rather than entering into a euphoric rally may be the prudent approach at this juncture. While SPY may seem like a stable choice, the undercurrents of risk deserve recognition, prompting a recommendation to **hold** rather than buy. In today\u2019s market, waiting for clearer stability could be the wiser, more strategic decision.",

Historical performances during previous overbought conditions, especially for the S&P 500, often led to prolonged uptrends rather than reversals.\n\n**Reflection on Past Lessons**: I acknowledge that there have been moments in history where overly cautious approaches to overbought indicators led to missed opportunities. For instance, during the robust bull market of 2020-2021, many analysts were overly wary of corrective movements due to high RSI levels, only to see the market continue its climb. It\u2019s crucial to differentiate between a true downturn and temporary market adjustments.\n\nMoreover, the current economic backdrop, with stable interest rates after the Fed\u2019s recent decision to maintain the federal funds rate at 5.25%, creates a conducive environment for equities. Investor confidence typically flourishes when rates stabilize, as is the case now.\n\n### Engagement and Final Thoughts\nIn conclusion, while bears may highlight overbought signals and recent volatility as red flags, the overwhelming growth potential, competitive advantages, and positive market sentiments toward SPY present a compelling case for taking a bullish stance. Recognizing when to act is part and parcel of investing, and given the solid fundamentals in place for SPY, the bullish outlook holds a stronger merit.\n\nI invite bears to consider these insights and reflect on their positions: to err on the side of caution might make sense in theory, but when the fundamentals and market dynamics are so robust, it often translates into missed opportunities. Let\u2019s not forget the lessons learned from past market cycles about embracing growth potential amidst uncertainty. \n\nThe recommended action here is to remain invested in SPY, as it stands to benefit from a dynamic market landscape demonstrating resilience and opportunity.\nBear Analyst: Absolutely, let\u2019s engage in this conversation and unpack the case against investing in SPY, while thoughtfully countering the bullish sentiments presented by my colleague.\n\n### Risks and Challenges\n\nFirst off, it\u2019s important to be mindful of the inherent risks in the current market landscape. The recent volatility you've noted\u2014with daily swings exceeding 3%\u2014is indicative of instability that should concern potential investors. While volatility can entice traders, it's equally a warning sign for long-term investors. The fact that algorithmic trading constituted **73% of the total volume** means that much of the trading activity is dictated by algorithms, which can add to market unpredictability. Such disproportionate reliance on algorithmic trading is often a harbinger of inflated prices and potential sharp corrections.\n\n### Market Saturation and Economic Threats\n\nRegarding growth potential, while SPY represents a broad swath of the market, one has to consider how much room is left for expansion. The S&P 500 has become increasingly saturated, making it difficult for many large-cap companies to sustain historic growth rates. We should not overlook the potential headwinds posed by macroeconomic factors such as persistent inflation, which the Federal Reserve is still grappling with despite keeping interest rates steady at **5.25%**. These macroeconomic variables threaten to erode consumer spending and sentiment, which are vital for driving the earnings growth that supports stock prices.\n\n### Competitive Weaknesses\n\nThough SPY is presented as having competitive advantages, it's also essential to reflect on its limitations. Its status as the first ETF tracking the S&P 500 may be an advantage, but it doesn't insulate it from competition. New entrants are constantly emerging with lower expense ratios and innovative structures that could draw investor attention away from SPY. \n\nAdditionally, let\u2019s critically assess the claim that SPY is a \u2018blue chip\u2019 investment. A passive fund\u2019s performance is inherently tied to the conditions of the underlying index. Should the S&P 500 face challenges\u2014be that economic recessions or sector-specific downturns\u2014SPY will suffer accordingly. Investments focused solely on passive strategies might be more vulnerable to changes in dynamics than those that leverage active management.\n\n### Negative Indicators \n\nThe technical indicators, such as the **RSI at 72.56**, signal an overbought condition that shouldn\u2019t be glossed over. While the bullish narrative frames this as a sign of resilience, it actually casts a shadow on sustainability. Overbought conditions often lead to corrections. In the past, over-reliance on buoyant market sentiment has led investors to accumulate positions right before major downturns, such as the sharp corrections in 2018 and 2020.\n\nFurthermore, the **Bollinger Bands** suggest SPY is trading near its upper band. Historically, such positioning tends to precede volatility and possible retractions, especially when coupled with high RSI readings. Bull analysts may argue that these indicators are typical in healthy bull markets, but even healthy markets correct.\n\n### Addressing Bull Counterpoints\n\nA common bullish comeback to overbought conditions is that they have historically ushered in prolonged uptrends. However, it\u2019s essential to contextualize this: much of the market's historical performance cannot be matched to the current economic environment characterized by supply chain issues, inflation, and high-interest rates. Past lessons learned during downturns have shown that continuous growth cannot be assumed, particularly when macroeconomic indicators signal potential trouble.\n\nMoreover, while SPY serves as a relative \u201csafe haven\u201d for investors in equity markets, its perceived stability is tenuous at best in this environment. Experiencing record inflows does not guarantee continued performance, especially if investor sentiment shifts as economic realities set in.\n\n### Engagement and Final Thoughts \n\nIn conclusion, while I acknowledge the potential bullish arguments presented, it's essential to critically evaluate the complex interplay of macroeconomic factors, competitive challenges, and overbought conditions fundamentally undermining SPY\u2019s current strength. \n\nInvestors should not overlook the lessons of the past\u2014such as the risks of ignoring market saturation, reliance on passive strategies amidst evolving market dynamics\u2014especially with indications signaling potential volatility ahead. Convincing a bull investor requires more than just momentum; it demands a comprehensive understanding of risk, and a proactive stance to not only pursue opportunities but to also manage potential losses.\n\nThus, staying cautious rather than entering into a euphoric rally may be the prudent approach at this juncture. While SPY may seem like a stable choice, the undercurrents of risk deserve recognition, prompting a recommendation to **hold** rather than buy. In today\u2019s market, waiting for clearer stability could be the wiser, more strategic decision.",
            "current_response": "Here\u2019s how I see it after weighing both sides:\n\nThe bull case hinges on the fact that SPY is riding a wave of robust earnings across technology, healthcare and renewables, all underpinned by a stable interest-rate environment.

Keep an eye on technical support near the 50-day simple moving average. If SPY tests that level (currently in the 660\u2013665 area) and holds, consider that a green light to top up.  \n4.

This time, my bias is toward capturing growth while respecting risk through a staggered entry. In sum: start buying now, add more on controlled pullbacks, and manage risk with trailing stops.

        "trader_investment_decision": "After careful consideration of the proposed investment plan for SPY, I see a clear pathway forward that balances both the bullish and bearish perspectives articulated. The analysis indicates a strong supporting environment for SPY, particularly with robust earnings, stable interest rates, and positive technical indicators such as being above the 50- and 200-day moving averages. Furthermore, the likelihood of continued positive momentum supported by passive inflows and the historical context of overbought conditions in bull markets lends weight to the bullish argument.\n\nThe concerns around volatility and the potential for sudden moves due to algorithmic trading are valid. However, they also present an opportunity to strategically enter positions while employing a disciplined risk management approach, which is smart. You\u2019ve highlighted a staggered entry strategy that not only captures growth potential but also mitigates risk, which is prudent given the current market conditions.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided analysis, my recommendation is to act on this proposed plan. \n\n**FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: BUY**",

The fact that algorithmic trading has accounted for 73% of the total trading volume should not induce fear; this is actually indicative of a highly dynamic market. The heightened volatility creates opportunities to capitalize on quick price movements, enabling traders to implement strategies such as options and stop-loss orders effectively. While the conservative view might suggest \"sitting on the sidelines\" due to fear of risk, savvy traders recognize that volatility, when managed intelligently, drives potential gains.\n\nNow, let\u2019s consider the caution against the current RSI level of 72.56, often interpreted as overbought. While it's true that overbought conditions can be a signal for potential pullbacks, they also reflect strong underlying momentum, suggesting that bullish sentiment is robust right now. A cautious approach risks missing significant upside. Investors often overlook that bull markets can maintain strength well into overbought territories, particularly when accompanied by strong earnings and positive economic indicators, as we've observed with SPY's continued buoyancy.\n\nOn to the technical analysis: the positioning of SPY above both the 50- and 200-day moving averages signifies a clear bullish trend. Conservative analysts seem to disregard this crucial indicator, possibly due to a preoccupation with short-term fluctuations. Ignoring the long-term trend for the fear of a brief downturn is akin to letting the noise distract from the signal. With strong technical indicators confirming momentum and ongoing passive inflows, there\u2019s substantial evidence to believe that SPY can sustain its upward trajectory.\n\nMoreover, I find the remarks about holding\u2014a strategy that may balance risk and reward\u2014overly cautious. In today\u2019s fast-paced market, doing so could lead to missed opportunities. Just look at the recent inflow data into comparable ETFs like IVV and VOO, which saw substantial interest. This reflects a broader trend where investors are seeking exposure to the S&P 500 to benefit from its inherent strengths even amid perceived risks. Rather than holding back, traders that seize this opportunity position themselves ahead of the curve, capturing growth while mainstream investors remain hesitant.\n\nIt\u2019s essential to highlight that the economic landscape, particularly with stable interest rates maintained by the Federal Reserve, does not present an environment that typically follows downturns; rather, it promotes risk-taking. The macroeconomic indicators, combined with the strong market sentiment captured from social media, further underscore the bullish outlook for SPY.\n\nIn conclusion, while it\u2019s important to remain aware of risks and employ disciplined risk management, let\u2019s not forget the compelling upside that SPY presents right now.

        "investment_plan": "Here\u2019s how I see it after weighing both sides:\n\nThe bull case hinges on the fact that SPY is riding a wave of robust earnings across technology, healthcare and renewables, all underpinned by a stable interest-rate environment. Its liquidity, low cost and status as the flagship S&P 500 vehicle mean every big money manager and algorithm wants in. Technically, price sits above both the 50- and 200-day averages, momentum indicators like MACD are bullish, and while the RSI is in overbought territory, history shows that in strong bull markets those overbought readings don\u2019t always lead to immediate reversals.\n\nThe bear case reminds us that volatility has spiked, daily swings north of 3\u2009percent can be jarring, and algorithmic trading \u2013 which now makes up 73\u2009percent of SPY volume \u2013 can amplify sudden moves. With the RSI above 70 and price pressing the upper Bollinger Band, a pullback is more than possible. Add in stubborn inflation and the risk of economic slowing, and you\u2019ve got reasons to pause before adding equity exposure here.\n\nMy call: Buy. Here\u2019s why. The broader market is being driven by genuine corporate profits, not just cheap money. The Fed\u2019s decision to hold rates at 5.25\u2009percent removes an immediate tightening threat, and passive flows into SPY show no signs of reversing. Yes, volatility can bite, but by building our position intelligently we tilt the odds in our favor.\n\nAction plan for rolling this out:\n\n1. Open a starter position now. Allocate roughly 40\u2009percent of your intended SPY buy target at the current levels around 683.40. This captures the momentum while leaving room for a better entry if the market fizzles.  \n2. Layer in additional buys on dips. Set limit orders to pick up another 30\u2009percent of your target if SPY falls 2\u2009percent below today\u2019s close, and the final 30\u2009percent if it\u2019s down 4\u2009percent.  \n3. Keep an eye on technical support near the 50-day simple moving average. If SPY tests that level (currently in the 660\u2013665 area) and holds, consider that a green light to top up.  \n4. Use a loose trailing stop (for example, 8\u2009percent below your average cost) to lock in gains if the market swings against you.  \n5. Review quarterly. Rebalance your target sizing relative to other holdings, and keep tabs on macro shifts\u2014if the Fed pivots to cutting rates, that\u2019s a bonus tailwind; if they signal more hikes, be ready to pause further buys.\n\nLooking back, I\u2019ve sometimes let overbought indicators scare me off too soon and missed solid uptrends. This time, my bias is toward capturing growth while respecting risk through a staggered entry. In sum: start buying now, add more on controlled pullbacks, and manage risk with trailing stops. That gives us the upside of the bull thesis without blindly ignoring the bear\u2019s warning signs.",
